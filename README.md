# Gallery-Frontend

Welcome to the Gallery-Frontend project! This is a simple frontend project where I've created a basic Gallery website. I started by designing the wireframe using Figma. You can view the wireframe [here](https://www.figma.com/file/JPU5Ajg7Kitp0FeZQojjAW/ARTZI?node-id=18%3A50&mode=dev).

## Project Overview

- **Design Stage**: I used Figma to design the wireframe for the Gallery website.
  
- **Technology Stack**: For the development of the website, I chose to use simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  
- **Future Plans**: I'm considering re-implementing this project using React in the future to make it more dynamic and interactive. Additionally, I might explore adding a backend to transform this into a complete website.
